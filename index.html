       <p>My family bought Snugs when he was 4 years old, from a breeder who had no use for him since he only had one testicle. Because of that, he was offered to us at 50% the price of the "normal" ones! That story may sound a bit quirky, but that's because he was. He was so pretty that everyone wanted to pet him, which he didn't like. So he'd try his best to keep to himself and only liked his family.</p>

       <p>Even though he was kind of weird, I miss him a lot. To be honest, I've been very blessed to not have much experience with death; his was my first memorable one and it was awful. But I won't mourne now, instead I'd like to highlight five of my favorite memories of him.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Like the time when he jumped out the window (of a parked car) to feed the ducks with us.</li>
        <li>Or that time he got stuck behind the thornes of a blackberry bush. (Don't worry, we saved him).</li>
        <li>He was the happiest and most playful in the mornings.</li>
        <li>His favorite food was cheese and watermelon.</li>
        <li>He never cared for toys, but loved playing underneath blankets.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p class="text-center">RIP Snugs! We miss you!</p>
